### Timer Logic

- Proper interval cleanup to prevent memory leaks.

### Theme System

- Custom theme context using React Context API.
- Persists user preference in `localStorage`.
- Supports system theme detection.

### SVG Progress Ring

- Built from scratch using SVG.
- Dynamically updates based on timer progress and mode.
- Smooth transitions and color changes.

### Session Statistics

- Tracks and displays completed Pomodoro sessions.
